### {{ page.header }}

For some time at [Faria][1] we share some tips in our distributed team to improve our synchronization on small details of our coding life. And all was good and fuzzy.

And then we realized that those could and should be shared outside of the circle of our team, so the idea of this site emerged and sounded like a good idea. So every week there will be a dozen tips published from our development team.

Oh those tips are not rocket science, many of them are very simple, tiny bits of usage, but even those feel good to share. Because the scope is internal we sometimes refer to the applications we are working on, like MB <http://managebac.com>, OA <http://openapply.com>, KB <http://keyb.com> or IS <http://intersis.com>.

Feel free to feedback to [devtips@faria.co][2].

_Note: you may also want to check [Green Ruby][3], it's another publication from mose. It is a list of links instead of tips but the idea is similar._
