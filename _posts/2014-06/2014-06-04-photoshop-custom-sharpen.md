Here is a useful and easy but professional photoshop tip. Use this following step to sharpen your image:

1. Open a photo and clone this image layer.
2. Select Filter > Other > High Pass (3.0 ~ 20.0) to the cloned layer.
3. Change the cloned layer type from Normal to Overlay

I usually do this before printing. It help getting a result of higher quality.
