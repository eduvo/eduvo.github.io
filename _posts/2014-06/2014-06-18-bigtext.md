Got some fun with this simple js plugin:

<https://github.com/zachleat/BigText>

Text size justification is based on font-size not its parent width or height. because it's difficult to fill the parent element fully just by kerning text. This can help us to do this dynamically.

Check the demo wizard at <http://www.zachleat.com/bigtext/demo/>
