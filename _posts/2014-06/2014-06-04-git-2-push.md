Git v2.0.0 is released

<http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1405.3/02592.html>

The biggest change is about "git push" behavior:

Before 2.0.0, the default git push is "matching" mode. It will push all your local branches to their matching ones on your remote repository when you "git push" without specifying a branch.

After 2.0.0, the default change to "simple" mode. It only pushes the current branch to the corresponding remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.
