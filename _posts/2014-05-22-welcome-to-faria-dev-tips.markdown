Here we are. For some time at Faria we share some tips in our distributed team to improve our synchronicity on small details of our coding life. And all was good and fuzzy.

And then we realized that those could and should be shared outside of the circle of our team, so the idea of this site emerged and sounded like a good idea. So here we are. Every week there will be one or 2 publications with either one or a serie of tips from our development team.

Oh those tips are not rocket science, many of them are very simple, tiny bits of usage, but even those feel good to share.

Feel free to feedback.
