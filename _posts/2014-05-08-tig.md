UA Team wants to share the info about tig - the cool command-line interface to git which you may find useful. We started to use it this week.

To install it: `brew install tig` (or `apt-get install tig`)

Then in your project directory type it: `tig`

The commits tree appears, where you can navigate it and see the individual commit changes, as well as do other geeky things :) Enjoy!
