Johnny is back this week and joins the geek fun with this small app. It is called Text Expander <https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander>. It can link a whole text to a user defined shortcut. I use it to fill in quickly for some canned info, replying BC and debugging.

Lets say I want to debug a paragraph of code with pry, and i am too lazy to type `binding.remote_pry` over and over. So I could link this code with `pry+SPACE` and next time i can spell it out when i need it.
