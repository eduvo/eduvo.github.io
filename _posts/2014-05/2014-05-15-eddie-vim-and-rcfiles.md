Mose sometimes uses vim on the side of ST3, and can't do it without the pretty good eddie kao set of config files.

Check it out at <https://github.com/kaochenlong/eddie-vim> it's tailored for rails dev. I gathered it (plus my oh-my-zsh setup) in my github rcfiles repo <https://github.com/mose/rcfiles> with an installer that I runs when I install a new server.
