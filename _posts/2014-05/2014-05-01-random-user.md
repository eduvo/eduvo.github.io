Oliver really like that Photoshop extension.

The <http://randomuser.me> website generates random user profiles for filling up user data on html mockups, like the lorem ipsum for users.

But there is also that photoshop extension for including random user photo on images <http://randomuser.me/extension> it's damn useful and better than default gravatars.
