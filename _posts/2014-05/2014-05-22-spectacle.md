Oliver has another app to talk about, a free window management tool for mac. Its name is spectacle. <http://spectacleapp.com>

I know some of our devs have their own tool to control window between apple 27" display and mbp (like moon, but it costs 9.99~19.99.).

Spectacle is free and simple. It’s worthy to try this if you haven’t subscribed any window control application.
