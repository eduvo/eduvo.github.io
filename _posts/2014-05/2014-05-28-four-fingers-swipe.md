Have a look at

- Divvy <https://mizage.com/divvy> (free trial or $14)
- BetterTouchTool <http://www.boastr.net> (free)

Used in conjunction, a MacBook user can assign four-finger swipe gestures to re-tile windows quickly. BetterTouchTool is capable of binding arbitrary gestures to arbitrary actions.
