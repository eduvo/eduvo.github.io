AaronH says: In iSIS we need search all school data in many different country, so I need check the search input size limit, default is 3 chars limit, but some school in China, Korea or Japan, people name only have 2~4 characters, if we still use limit size 3, it no make sense, so I use RegExp to check inputing word in a smart way.
