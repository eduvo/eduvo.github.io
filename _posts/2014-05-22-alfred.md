There is one app heavily used by Johnny, named Alfred <http://www.alfredapp.com>

It is good for launch tasks by typing command. For example, I want to look up a work I don't know I can type:

    LAUNCHKEY + define + WORD_I_DONT_KNOW

and it will open the dictionary in Mac for explanation.

It also have a powerful function called `WorkFlow`. It allows you to combine multiple action at once. Recently I wrote a work flow to launch Transmit to sync the daily db dump folder on OA production server because I noticed I pretty much have to do this every other day.
