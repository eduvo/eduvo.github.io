Sometime we need to work on some analytics feature. [totalizer][1] is a chrome extension that can help with that on displayed tables in the browser.

When you have a table you want to work on, click the 'Totalizer' icon in the toolbar. You can now right click on a table column and choose a simple spreadsheet function like sum, average, etc. Simple and useful.
