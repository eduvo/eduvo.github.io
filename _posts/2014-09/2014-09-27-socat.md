Check out <http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat>, it's a very powerful relay tool between tcp, unix domain socket, stdout and lots of protocol.

For testing domain socket, you don't have to install nginx. I use this for my docker qa env because I don't want to mess with multiple docker ports > host nginx. So in docker, I relay tcp port to unix domain socket and mount to host.
