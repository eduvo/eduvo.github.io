It's very convenient for front-end developer if you use font awesome icons in your design. To use font awesome in photoshop:

1. download the zip from <https://fontawesome.io/icons>
2. install FontAwesome.otf
3. go to cheatsheet <http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet>, copy the icon directly
4. paste in photoshop text layer, you should see a square

5. choose FontAwesome as the font-face

Again, front-end developers will love you when they get to write the CSS.
