Rails provides the command

    rake db:seed

to seed the database. However, sometimes we want to have different db seed for different RAIL_ENV or maybe you just need to seed some data repeatedly. Then the task become inappropriate.

Seedbank <https://github.com/james2m/seedbank> solves this problem.

    # in your gemfile
    gem 'seedbank'

The directory structure

    db/
      seeds.rb
      seeds/
        bar.seeds.rb
        development/
          users.seeds.rb

Now when you issue `rake db:seed` it will invoke

    db/seeds.rb
    db/seeds/*

When you issue `RAILS_ENV=development rake db:seed`

    db/seeds.rb
    db/seeds/bar.seeds.rb
    db/seeds/development/*

And on `RAILS_ENV=production rake db:seed`

    db/seeds.rb
    db/seeds/bar.seeds.rb

Or you just want to seed the users, you can do

    rake db:seed:development:users
