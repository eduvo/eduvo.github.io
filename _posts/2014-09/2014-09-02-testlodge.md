This is an online test case management tool, not very expensive. Users can create projects, test plans (which is based on project release), test cases and test runs on the registered website.

- <http://www.testlodge.com>

After registration, all authorized people can access online test cases via assigned URL, like http://yourproject.testlodge.com/

### Basic features

- Grant access & Add people: All granted people can access URL successfully

No "Add Tags" feature to categorise cases into "Automatically" and "Manually" cases.

(I'm trying another tool now. Will post my feedback in next devtips).
