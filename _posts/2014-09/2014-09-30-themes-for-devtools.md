Chrome announced this experimental feature in December 2013, and there is a lot of themes already on the Chrome Web Store for download.

To enable this feature, just

- open your DevTools (ctrl/cmd)-alt-i,
- go to settings,
- click the Experiments tab,
- check the "Allow Custom UI themes",
- then install a theme from web store,

I like this one <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/devtools-theme-zero-dark/bomhdjeadceaggdgfoefmpeafkjhegbo>.

When you installed a theme, you have to restart chrome, and when open the devtools again, you can see the inspector applied the theme that you installed.
