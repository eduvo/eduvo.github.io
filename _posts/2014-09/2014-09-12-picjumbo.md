I have a nice photo library to share called picjumbo.

- <http://picjumbo.com>

It contains high quality photos and they are able for commercial or personal use.

There’s a plugin about picjumbo made by sorece for photoshop <http://picjumbo.madebysource.com>
It’s very convenient but it cost $11,99.
