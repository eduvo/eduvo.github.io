Oliver tells us about Cloudup. Basically this is a free version droplr (up to 1,000 items or 200 GB). If you haven’t subscribed droplr, you can try this first. Check it at <https://cloudup.com>

Pro tip: When you get the Cloudup url like this -> https://cloudup.com/cvWnAWh1kiA Add a ‘+’ at the end (https://cloudup.com/cvWnAWh1kiA+) then you can get the pure source file without Cloudup’s web frame. (This tip works on droplr too).
