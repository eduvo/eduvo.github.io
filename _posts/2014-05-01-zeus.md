Stephen is very happy with Zeus for speeding up his testing on OpenApply. But he also like to use tags in his tests to selectively launch specs collections rather than the whole thing:

{% highlight ruby %}
  context 'enrollment', for_test: true do
    xxx
  end
{% endhighlight %}

and then

{% highlight bash %}
  zeus rspec â€”tag=for_test
{% endhighlight %}
