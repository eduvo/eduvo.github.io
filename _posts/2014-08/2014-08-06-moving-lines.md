At Faria we use [hackpad][1] a lot.

It has bunch of shortcuts, like cmd+b for bold, cmd+i for italic), cmd+u forunderline, cmd+e for highlight. The full list is there:

but there are one shortcut not listed in the pad: `option + ↑/↓`, you can move whole line up and down.

It works like the `ctrl + cmd + ↑/↓` in sublime text.
