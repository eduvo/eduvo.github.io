This week i’d like to share may mac setting. I am a big fan of mac's “hot corner” setting. Say, when I want to visit desktop, I just move the cursor the the top right corner. 

please see screenshot to refer how to apply this setting :

After you press the 'Hot Corners' button, you get a settings window :

That's it and this makes it so easier to allow you to access your desktop !
