iHower wanted to point out 2 talks from rubyconf we attended last week, that report about rails upgrade:

* <https://speakerdeck.com/hsbt/from-legacy-to-edge-2014-edition-1>
  * hsbt upgraded Ruby 1.8.6/Rails 2.0.2 to Ruby 2.1.1/Rails 4.1. He notes that new Ruby is faster, but new Rails is slower.
* <http://xinminlabs.github.io/synvert-rubyconf-tw-2014/#/53>
  * flyerhzm talks about this gem <https://github.com/xinminlabs/synvert> that provides syntax conversion.
